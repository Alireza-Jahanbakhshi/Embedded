UART_TX_RX
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) implements UART communication at 9600 baud (8N1) for both transmitting and receiving data. It sends "Hello from ATmega16!" every second, receives a string (up to 31 characters plus null terminator) until a newline or carriage return, and echoes it back prefixed with "Received:". The code uses polling for simplicity.

Key Features:
1. UART Configuration:
   - 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
   - Baud prescaler: 51 (~0.2% error at 8 MHz)
   - Transmit and receive enabled

2. Transmit/Receive Functions:
   - Single character TX/RX with polling
   - String TX for null-terminated strings
   - String RX until newline/CR or buffer full (32 bytes)

3. Operation Logic:
   - Sends fixed message every 1 second
   - Receives and echoes input with prefix
   - Continuous loop with 1-second delays

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - UART TX (PD1), RX (PD0) to serial terminal/PC
   - Two-pin usage for full-duplex communication
   - Typical setup for serial interfacing

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Periodic 1-second transmissions
   - Immediate echo of received data
   - Suitable for interactive communication

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses UART module and 2 I/O pins (PD0, PD1)
   - 32-byte RAM buffer for receive
   - Polling-based, no interrupts

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Simplicity:
   - Easy UART TX/RX implementation
   - Clear send/receive example
   - Minimal setup requirements

2. Functionality:
   - Full-duplex communication
   - String handling with termination
   - Useful for user input/output

3. Debug Support:
   - Echo feature aids testing
   - Periodic output for monitoring
   - Good for serial debugging

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Add interrupt-driven UART
2. Implement timeout for RX
3. Add error checking (e.g., buffer overflow)
4. Include power-saving modes

Typical Applications:
- Serial communication interfaces
- Debugging via terminal
- Simple command/response systems
- Educational projects for UART basics
