TIM_PWMOutput
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) generates a PWM signal on PD5 (OC1A) using Timer1 in 10-bit Fast PWM mode. It configures the timer with no prescaler (31.25 kHz frequency) and ramps the duty cycle from 0 to 1023 and back down in steps of 10, with a 10ms delay per step, creating a continuous fade-in/fade-out effect.

Key Features:
1. PWM Configuration:
   - Timer1, 10-bit Fast PWM (TOP=1023)
   - Prescaler 1, frequency: 8 MHz / 1024 = ~31.25 kHz
   - Non-inverting mode on PD5 (OC1A)

2. Duty Cycle Control:
   - 0-1023 range (10-bit resolution)
   - Increments/decrements by 10
   - 10ms delay per step (full cycle ~20.5s)

3. Operation Logic:
   - Continuous ramp up and down
   - Blocking delay implementation
   - Simple infinite loop

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PD5 (OC1A) to PWM output (e.g., LED, motor)
   - Single-pin usage with current-limiting resistor if needed
   - Typical setup for analog-like control

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Smooth duty cycle transitions
   - Fixed 10ms step timing
   - Suitable for fading or speed control

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses Timer1 and 1 I/O pin (PD5)
   - Minimal code size with basic loops
   - No interrupts, polling-based

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Precision:
   - High 10-bit resolution (1024 levels)
   - Fast 31.25 kHz PWM frequency
   - Smooth duty cycle ramping

2. Simplicity:
   - Easy to configure and test
   - Clear PWM example
   - Minimal resource requirements

3. Versatility:
   - Adjustable step size and delay
   - Extensible for specific duty cycles
   - Good for PWM demonstrations

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Add input control for duty cycle
2. Use interrupts for timing
3. Implement custom waveforms
4. Add power-saving modes

Typical Applications:
- LED brightness fading
- Motor speed ramping
- Analog signal simulation
- Educational projects for PWM basics
