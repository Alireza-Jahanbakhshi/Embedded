TIM_PWM_L298
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) demonstrates PWM-based speed control and direction control of a DC motor using an L298 motor driver. It configures Timer1 in Fast PWM mode (8-bit resolution, 488 Hz frequency) on PB1 (OC1A) for speed control and uses PD0/PD1 for direction control. The code cycles the motor through forward (70% speed), stop, reverse (50% speed), and stop states with fixed delays.

Key Features:
1. PWM Configuration:
   - Timer1 Fast PWM, 8-bit (TOP=255), prescaler 64
   - Frequency: 8 MHz / 64 / 256 = ~488 Hz
   - PB1 (OC1A) outputs PWM signal

2. Motor Control:
   - PD0 (IN1) and PD1 (IN2) for L298 direction
   - Forward (1), Reverse (2), Stop (0) states
   - Speed set via OCR1A (0-255)

3. Operation Sequence:
   - Forward at 70% (178/255) for 2s
   - Stop for 1s
   - Reverse at 50% (127/255) for 2s
   - Stop for 1s

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PB1 (PWM) to L298 ENA (enable A)
   - PD0, PD1 to L298 IN1, IN2 (direction)
   - L298 outputs to DC motor; requires 12V supply

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Precise PWM speed control
   - Fixed timing sequence (6s cycle)
   - Suitable for motor-driven applications

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses Timer1 and 3 I/O pins (PB1, PD0, PD1)
   - Minimal code size with simple logic
   - No interrupts, blocking delays

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Precision:
   - Accurate PWM duty cycle control
   - Reliable direction switching
   - Consistent timing via delays

2. Simplicity:
   - Easy to configure and test
   - Clear motor control example
   - Minimal setup requirements

3. Versatility:
   - Adjustable speed and timing
   - Extensible for dual motors (L298 B channel)
   - Good base for motor projects

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Add input for speed/direction control
2. Use interrupts for timing
3. Implement speed ramping
4. Add current sensing/protection

Typical Applications:
- DC motor speed/direction control
- Robotics or automation
- Fan/pump speed regulation
- Educational projects for PWM/motor control
