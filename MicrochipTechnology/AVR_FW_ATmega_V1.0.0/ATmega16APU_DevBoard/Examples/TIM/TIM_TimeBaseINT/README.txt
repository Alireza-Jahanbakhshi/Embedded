TIM_TimeBaseINT
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) uses Timer0 in normal mode with a prescaler of 1024 and an interrupt-driven approach to toggle an LED on PB0. The timer overflows every 32.768 ms (8 MHz / 1024 / 256), and the ISR counts 15 overflows (~491.52 ms) to toggle the LED, resulting in a ~983 ms blink period (on/off cycle). Unlike its polling counterpart, this uses interrupts for efficiency.

Key Features:
1. Timer Configuration:
   - Timer0, normal mode, prescaler 1024
   - Overflow period: 8 MHz / 1024 / 256 = 32.768 ms
   - Interrupt-driven overflow handling

2. LED Control:
   - PB0 as output for LED toggling
   - Toggles every 15 overflows (~491.52 ms)
   - Full cycle ~983 ms (on + off)

3. Operation Logic:
   - ISR handles overflow counting and toggling
   - Main loop free for other tasks
   - Volatile variable for ISR safety

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PB0 to LED with current-limiting resistor
   - Single-pin usage for output
   - Typical setup for interrupt-based timing

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Precise ~983 ms blink period
   - Interrupt-driven for consistent timing
   - Suitable for periodic tasks

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses Timer0 and 1 I/O pin (PB0)
   - Minimal code size with ISR
   - Efficient interrupt usage

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Efficiency:
   - Interrupt-driven, frees main loop
   - Low CPU overhead for timing
   - Reliable 32.768 ms overflow timing

2. Simplicity:
   - Easy to implement and test
   - Clear interrupt-based example
   - Minimal hardware requirements

3. Versatility:
   - Adjustable period via overflow count
   - Main loop available for other tasks
   - Good for multitasking systems

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Add configurable toggle period
2. Implement multiple outputs
3. Add power-saving sleep modes
4. Include ISR safety checks (e.g., atomicity)

Typical Applications:
- Periodic status indicators
- Background timing tasks
- Event scheduling in multitasking
- Educational projects for interrupts/timers
