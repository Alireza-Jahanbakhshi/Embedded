TIM_TimeBase
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) uses Timer0 in normal mode with a prescaler of 1024 to create a time base for toggling an LED on PB0. The timer overflows every 32.768 ms (8 MHz / 1024 / 256), and the code counts 15 overflows (~491.52 ms) to toggle the LED, resulting in a ~983 ms blink period (on/off cycle).

Key Features:
1. Timer Configuration:
   - Timer0, normal mode, prescaler 1024
   - Overflow period: 8 MHz / 1024 / 256 = 32.768 ms
   - Polling-based overflow detection

2. LED Control:
   - PB0 as output for LED toggling
   - Toggles every 15 overflows (~491.52 ms)
   - Full cycle ~983 ms (on + off)

3. Operation Logic:
   - Infinite loop polling TOV0 flag
   - Manual flag clearing and overflow counting
   - Simple time-based toggle

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PB0 to LED with current-limiting resistor
   - Single-pin usage for output
   - Typical setup for timing demonstrations

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - ~983 ms blink period
   - Precise timing via timer overflows
   - Suitable for periodic tasks

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses Timer0 and 1 I/O pin (PB0)
   - Minimal code size with basic logic
   - No interrupts, polling-based

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Simplicity:
   - Easy to implement and understand
   - Clear timer-based example
   - Minimal hardware requirements

2. Accuracy:
   - Consistent 32.768 ms overflow timing
   - Reliable toggle period (~983 ms)
   - Good for basic timekeeping

3. Versatility:
   - Adjustable period via overflow count
   - Extensible for other timing tasks
   - Useful for timing experiments

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Use interrupts for overflow handling
2. Add configurable toggle period
3. Implement multiple outputs
4. Add power-saving modes

Typical Applications:
- LED blinker for status indication
- Basic timing or scheduling tasks
- Time-based event triggering
- Educational projects for timers
