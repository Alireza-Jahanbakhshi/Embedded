ADC_MultiChannel_Polling
----------------------------

Description:
This is an AVR microcontroller program (written for an 8 MHz clock) that demonstrates multi-channel ADC polling with LCD display output. The code interfaces an LM35 temperature sensor (ADC0) and a secondary ADC channel (ADC1, e.g., potentiometer) with a 16x2 LCD in 4-bit mode. It continuously reads ADC values, converts the LM35 reading to temperature, and displays both results on the LCD.

Key Features:
1. ADC Configuration:
   - Uses AVCC as reference voltage with external capacitor
   - 10-bit resolution (0-1023)
   - Prescaler set to 128 (62.5 kHz ADC clock at 8 MHz F_CPU)
   - Polling-based conversion for two channels (ADC0 and ADC1)

2. LCD Interface:
   - 4-bit mode operation (D4-D7 on PORTD, RS and E on PORTB)
   - Custom functions for commands, data, initialization, and printing
   - Supports 16x2 display with cursor positioning

3. Data Processing:
   - Custom integer-to-string conversion for ADC values (0-1023)
   - Custom float-to-string conversion for temperature display
   - Temperature calculation from LM35 (10mV/Â°C)

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - ADC0 (PA0) connects to LM35 temperature sensor
   - ADC1 (PA1) available for additional analog sensor (e.g., potentiometer)
   - LCD connected via PORTD (D4-D7) and PORTB (RS, E)
   - Typical embedded system setup with analog sensing and visual output

2. Real-Time Monitoring:
   - Continuous polling of sensor data
   - 500ms update rate suitable for environmental monitoring
   - Direct hardware control without RTOS dependency

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Efficient use of AVR I/O ports
   - Minimal RAM usage with custom string conversion (avoids sprintf)
   - Optimized for small embedded systems with limited resources

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Efficiency:
   - Lightweight code with no external library dependencies
   - Custom conversion routines save memory compared to standard libraries
   - Polling approach eliminates interrupt overhead

2. Flexibility:
   - Easily adaptable to other ADC channels (up to 8 on most AVR MCUs)
   - LCD functions reusable for other display purposes
   - Modular structure allows easy sensor additions

3. Practicality:
   - Real-world application for temperature monitoring
   - Clear visual feedback via LCD
   - Simple calibration for different sensors

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Add error handling for ADC readings
2. Implement power-saving modes between readings
3. Add interrupt-driven ADC for better efficiency
4. Include sensor calibration constants

Typical Applications:
- Environmental monitoring systems
- Industrial temperature control
- Educational embedded systems projects
- Home automation sensor nodes
