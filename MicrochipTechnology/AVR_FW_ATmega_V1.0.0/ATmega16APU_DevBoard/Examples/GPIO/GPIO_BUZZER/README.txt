GPIO_BUZZER
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) demonstrates basic GPIO control to drive a buzzer connected to PB0 (PORTB, Pin 0). The code generates a simple square wave by toggling the pin high and low with 500ms delays, producing an audible tone with a period of 1 second. Itâ€™s a minimalistic example of GPIO usage for generating sound output.

Key Features:
1. GPIO Configuration:
   - Single output pin (PB0) configured as output
   - Initialized to low state
   - Direct register manipulation for control

2. Timing Control:
   - Uses _delay_ms() for 500ms on/off periods
   - Generates a 1 Hz square wave (1-second cycle)
   - Blocking delay implementation

3. Simple Structure:
   - Infinite loop with basic bit manipulation
   - No interrupts or complex logic
   - Straightforward on/off toggling

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PB0 connects to a buzzer (active-high, likely with a transistor driver)
   - Minimal pin usage (1 GPIO pin)
   - Common setup for audio feedback in embedded devices

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Produces consistent 1 Hz tone
   - Blocking delays ensure predictable timing
   - Suitable for basic alert or status indication

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses only one I/O pin
   - Minimal code size and memory footprint
   - No additional hardware timers required

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Simplicity:
   - Easy to implement and understand
   - Ideal for beginners learning GPIO control
   - Requires minimal setup and resources

2. Reliability:
   - Predictable timing with fixed delays
   - No external dependencies or complex logic
   - Robust for continuous operation

3. Versatility:
   - Easily adjustable frequency via delay changes
   - Can be adapted to other pins or outputs
   - Basis for more complex tone generation

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Use timers for non-blocking operation
2. Add frequency control (e.g., via variable delays)
3. Implement duty cycle variation for volume control
4. Add sleep modes for power efficiency between tones

Typical Applications:
- Simple alarms or alerts
- Status indicators (e.g., power-on beep)
- Educational projects for GPIO learning
