GPIO_STEPPER
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) controls a unipolar stepper motor using PORTC (PC0-PC3) via a ULN2003 driver. The code implements full-step drive with a predefined sequence, rotating the motor 200 steps clockwise and counterclockwise alternately, with a 10ms delay between steps and a 1-second pause between directions.

Key Features:
1. GPIO Configuration:
   - PC0-PC3 as outputs for stepper motor coils
   - Uses lower 4 bits of PORTC
   - Direct register control

2. Stepper Control:
   - Full-step sequence (0b1000, 0b0100, 0b0010, 0b0001)
   - Supports clockwise (direction=1) and counterclockwise (direction=0)
   - Custom delay function for step timing

3. Motion Logic:
   - 200 steps per rotation (adjustable)
   - 10ms step delay (variable via function)
   - 1-second pause between direction changes

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PORTC (PC0-PC3) connects to ULN2003 inputs
   - ULN2003 outputs drive stepper motor coils
   - Typical setup for small stepper motor control

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Precise step timing with custom delay
   - Bidirectional rotation with pauses
   - Suitable for positioning or movement tasks

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses 4 GPIO pins on PORTC
   - Small code size with static sequence array
   - No interrupts, relying on blocking delays

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Precision:
   - Controlled stepping for accurate positioning
   - Consistent timing via custom delay
   - Reliable full-step sequence

2. Simplicity:
   - Easy to understand and modify
   - Minimal setup for stepper control
   - No external libraries required

3. Flexibility:
   - Adjustable steps, delay, and direction
   - Sequence adaptable for half-step drive
   - Good base for motor control projects

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Use timers for non-blocking step timing
2. Add acceleration/deceleration profiles
3. Implement input control for direction/speed
4. Add power-saving modes between movements

Typical Applications:
- Small robotic movements
- Automated positioning systems
- Stepper-based actuators
- Educational projects for motor control
