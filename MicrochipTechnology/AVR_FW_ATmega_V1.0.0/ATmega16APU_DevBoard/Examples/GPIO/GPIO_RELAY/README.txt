GPIO_RELAY
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) demonstrates GPIO control to toggle a relay connected to PB0 (PORTB, Pin 0). The code configures PB0 as an output and toggles it every 2 seconds using the XOR operator, creating a simple on/off pattern suitable for relay switching applications.

Key Features:
1. GPIO Configuration:
   - PB0 set as output, all other PORTB pins as inputs
   - Initialized to low state
   - Direct register manipulation

2. Toggling Mechanism:
   - Uses XOR (^=) to toggle PB0 state
   - 2-second delay between toggles
   - Produces a 0.25 Hz square wave (4-second period)

3. Simple Structure:
   - Infinite loop with no conditional logic
   - Single-pin control
   - Blocking delay implementation

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - PB0 connects to a relay module (typically via a transistor or driver)
   - Single-pin usage leaves other pins free
   - Common setup for controlling external loads

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Consistent 2-second toggle timing
   - Predictable on/off pattern
   - Suitable for periodic switching tasks

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses only one GPIO pin (PB0)
   - Minimal code size and memory footprint
   - No additional hardware timers required

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Simplicity:
   - Easy to implement and test
   - Ideal for basic relay control
   - Minimal setup requirements

2. Reliability:
   - Fixed timing with 2-second intervals
   - No external dependencies
   - Stable operation for continuous use

3. Versatility:
   - Toggle period adjustable via delay
   - Easily adaptable to other pins
   - Basis for more complex relay control

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Use timers for non-blocking toggling
2. Add input trigger for relay control
3. Implement duty cycle variation
4. Add power-saving sleep modes

Typical Applications:
- Periodic load switching (e.g., lights, pumps)
- Relay testing or demonstration
- Simple automation tasks
- Educational projects for GPIO output
