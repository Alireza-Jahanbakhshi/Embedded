I2C_AT24C02
----------------------------

Description:
This AVR microcontroller program (designed for an 8 MHz clock) demonstrates I2C communication with an AT24C02 EEPROM and UART output for debugging. It uses the AVR's TWI (I2C) module to write and read a test byte (0xAA) to/from address 0x10 in the EEPROM, then verifies the operation via UART at 9600 baud. The code includes initialization and basic functions for UART, TWI, and EEPROM operations.

Key Features:
1. I2C/TWI Configuration:
   - 100 kHz clock frequency
   - Communicates with AT24C02 EEPROM (address 0xA0)
   - Supports start, stop, write, and read operations

2. UART Configuration:
   - 9600 baud rate
   - 8-bit data, 1 stop bit
   - Functions for transmitting characters, strings, and hex values

3. EEPROM Operations:
   - Write byte to specified address with 5ms delay
   - Read byte using random read with repeated start
   - Test sequence writes 0xAA and verifies readback

Connections to Embedded Systems:
1. Hardware Integration:
   - SDA and SCL pins (PC0, PC1 on ATmega16) to AT24C02
   - UART TX (PD1) to serial terminal or PC
   - Typical setup for non-volatile storage and debugging

2. Real-Time Operation:
   - Synchronous I2C transactions
   - Immediate UART feedback for testing
   - Suitable for data logging or configuration storage

3. Resource Utilization:
   - Uses TWI module and UART hardware
   - Moderate code size with debug output
   - No interrupts, relying on polling

Pros for Embedded Applications:
1. Functionality:
   - Reliable EEPROM read/write operations
   - Clear UART feedback for verification
   - Practical for persistent data storage

2. Debug Support:
   - Hex output aids troubleshooting
   - Detailed test messages via UART
   - Easy to monitor I2C operations

3. Modularity:
   - Reusable TWI and UART functions
   - Extensible for multi-byte operations
   - Good foundation for I2C-based projects

Potential Improvements for Embedded Use:
1. Add error checking for TWI status
2. Implement interrupt-driven UART
3. Support multi-byte read/write
4. Add power-saving modes in main loop

Typical Applications:
- Configuration data storage
- Data logging systems
- Device parameter retention
- Educational projects for I2C and UART
